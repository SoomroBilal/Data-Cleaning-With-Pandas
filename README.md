# Data-Cleaning-With-Pandas
In this project, I have taken a messy data and cleaned using pandas.
Cleaning processing included:

1. Standardizing column names.
2. Removing or filling null values in columns such as salary and age.
3. Bringing consistency in categorical data in columns such as department.
4. Handling date column by converting to pandas date object in columns such as join date.
5. Finally exporting the cleaned dataset.
